# Exploring Go Code

## Server

The obvious Go file to start exploring is `cmd/api/main.go` as it is the entry point of this module.

The `main.go` file calls the `server/server.go` package.

## `server.go`

### Blank Identifier

The import statement uses a [blank identifier](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Blank_identifier) for the autoload library, <br />
I did not know that you could use a blank identifier for importing in Go before. <br />
I looked it up in the Go specs, and the blank identifier tells Go that this module is loaded to just call the `init` function and this module won't be called in the code.

### net/http Library

`&http.Server` struct has some fields that might be relevant. <br />

`Addr` takes in a `string` in the form of 'host:port', interestingly in the code `:8080` is passed as a value.

The [`net/http`](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http#Server) docs for `Addr` says that the format of the string is specified by [`net/Dial`](https://pkg.go.dev/net#Dial). <br />
`net/Dial` docs say that if the host is empty then the local system is assumed.

The `handler` value is a method named `RegisterRoutes()`, the method is defined on the `Server` struct and in a different file called `routes.go`

I found the code a bit jarring to read because it was not explicit where the `RegisterRoutes` method is defined.

Generally, The Type, Factory Functions, and Methods should be defined together in the chronological order in the same file, the methods should not be scattered around.

This is something that I learnt in the Ultimate Go course by Ardan Labs. Here are details of where I learnt this: <br />
**Timestamp**: [8:24](https://courses.ardanlabs.com/courses/take/ultimate-go/lessons/7419439-4-1-1-methods-part-1-value-pointer-semantics)<br />
**Video**: 4.1.1 - Methods-Part 1 (Value & Pointer Semantics)

However, I think this is a good exception, handler functions and the routes are defined in the same file which makes it easy to work with the routes.

### `http.Handler`

The [`Handler`](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http#Handler) type responds to an HTTP request. <br/>
A `ServeMux` can be used as an `Handler` because it implements [`ServerHTTP`](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http#ServeMux.ServeHTTP).

`ServerMux` maps the incoming request's URL patterns with a list of registered patterns and calls the appropriate function.

Now we can use `ServerMux` to execute _handler_ functions according to the route on which we recieved a request. <br />
The handler functions we execute can use the data from the request and write a response back. <br />
The signature of handler functions look like: `handler func(http.ResponseWriter, *http.Request)` as specified by the `mux.HandleFunc()`.

## Database

The [`pgx`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/jackc/pgx/v5@v5.5.5#section-readme) (Postgres Go Driver) and `godotenv` are imported with a blank identifier.

Using the `database/sql` interfaces for connection is an interesting choice, the documentation says the `pgx` interface is faster and is recommended when â€“

- The application only targets PostgreSQL.
- No other libraries that require database/sql are in use.

The Go module does not seem to use `database/sql` for any other libraries and is only targetting PostgreSQL <br />
I think using `database/sql` helps with future proofing in case we want to use a library that uses `database/sql`

The `init` function of `pgx` implements the [`database/sql/driver`](https://pkg.go.dev/database/sql/driver) and [loads it](https://github.com/jackc/pgx/blob/523411a3fbcb76daf4eb3bc60326e2a68115e92f/stdlib/sql.go#L94). <br /> I could not find this information in the `pgx` documentation, so I thought it might be helpful to understand why we do an import with a blank identifier.

```go
ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 1*time.Second)
```

I don't completely understand `context` in Go, specifically why `context.Background()` is used instead of `context.Context` as in the [documentation of the `PingContext`](https://pkg.go.dev/database/sql#DB.PingContext) methood. It's worth exploring the [Go concurreny patern `context`](https://go.dev/blog/context).

The `Health` and `Close` functions are pretty straightforward, I can see how struct types can be utilized to create abstractions over an existing API.
